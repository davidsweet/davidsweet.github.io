		<h1 id="burning">My Vision</h1>
		<p id="exp">
			I want to create a product that increases communication between dancers and their teachers. As a whole, dancing is very individualistic and pertains to each person differently, by creating an organized interface in
			which the teacher and students can interact with each other, the rate at which this art-form is learned can significantly increase.

		<h2 class="subject">How It Works</h2>
		<h2 class="inline">1) </h2>
		<p class="inline"> A student will make an account with basic information</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2 class="inline">2) </h2>
		<p class="inline"> In order to join a class a student must look up the teacher in the directory and send a request</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2 class="inline">3) </h2>
		<p class="inline"> A student has as much access to content as the teacher allows</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2 class="inline">4) </h2>
		<p class="inline"> By posting videos, comments, and instructions, students can interact with their teach as well as other students</p>
		<br><br>
		
		
		<h2 class="subject">Basic Layout</h2>
		<p> The teacher sets his page to have tabs for different subjects such as the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Videos of well known dancers</li>
			<li> Videos of the teacher's own choreography</li>
			<li> Video responses of the student's individual performance</li>
			<li> Listings of music used during class</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 class="subject">Exclusive Privilege</h2>
		<p> 
			One concern of a mass spread of dance material is the loss of the teacher's intellectual property; many teachers prefer that
			their choreography is not recorded in order to maintain an inflow of students. Teachers will be able to set up different access levels
			that can be applied to each student. For example, only the students that attended class can view that day's choreography. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="font-size:300%">Possible Extensions</h2>
		<p>
			This opens the door for a potential compatible software that keeps track of which student attends which class, then using that information 
			to apply restrictions. This allows an automatic application of access levels to students without requiring a manual assignment. Other aspects
			of this other program is the display of attendance chart in a variety of forms which displays attendance levels over time, inflow of money from 
			students and expenditures due to studio room rental costs. A calendar could be used to plan future private lessons, workshops, and could allow 
			students to request private lessons more easily.
